# Rust on Embedded Devices Working Group

This organization focuses on improving the end-to-end experience of using Rust in resource-constrained environments and non-traditional platforms.

We are an [official working group](https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/wgs/embedded) of the Rust language.

**Want to get started with embedded development with Rust?** Check out our
[embedded Rust book][book] and the rest of our [bookshelf].

## Vision

What is it that we really want? At a broad level:

- To improve the absolute quality (functionality, safety, performance) of embedded software in the
  wild.
- To improve the productivity of embedded software development teams, by reducing the tangible and
  intangible costs of achieving a level of quality.
- To improve the experience for programmers developing for embedded systems.
- To make embedded systems programming more accessible for people that are not already embedded
  systems developers.
